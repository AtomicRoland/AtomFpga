A Real Time Clock for the FPGAtom - created by Roland LeursVersion 1.0 June 26, 2019Registers:#BFD0 year#BFD1 month (bit 0..3) and day of the week (bit 4..7)#BFD2 day#BFD3 hours#BFD4 minutes#BFD5 seconds#BFD6 interrupt control#BFD7 interrupt statusTo set the clock, simply write the correct values to the year, month etc registers. The RTC accepts invalid values, so garbage in is garbage out. For the day of the week use 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday etc.Interrupts are controlled at #BFD6:bit 0: 0.1 sec interruptbit 1: 1 sec interruptbit 2: 1 min interruptbit 3: 1 hour interruptbit 4: 1 day interruptbit 5: 1 month interruptbit 6: 1 year interruptBit 7 does not control an interrupt but holds the clock for reading and writing time and date. If set the time is not updated so this avoids roll-overs during reads and writes of time and date.Register #BFD7 indicates which interrupt(s) have occurred. Bits 0 .. 6 are according to the control register. If bit 7 is set then an interrupt has occurred. Writing any value to #BFD7 clears all interrupt flags.Interrupts are disabled after power on and a reset of the Atom.
