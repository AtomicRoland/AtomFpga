This program shows the date and time on the FPGAtom on the top line of the screen. It works in both Atom VDU32 
and in Godil VGA80 mode (you can call this a responsive application).
In the default configuration it will be assembled at #600 and it is 512 bytes long.

The RTC.MAN file is the man page for the real time clock. Simply copy this file to the /MANPAGES folder on your MMC card to use it.
